## Technical Roadblocks

### 1. Synchronization Complexity

**Challenge**: Maintaining precise time and frequency synchronization across geographically distributed nodes over IP networks.

**Specific Issues**:
- Network latency variations affecting timestamp accuracy
- Clock drift between GPS disciplined oscillators
- Phase coherence for advanced applications
- Internet connectivity interruptions breaking sync

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- **Tiered Synchronization Approach**: Accept that different applications have different sync requirements
  - Level 1: Basic frequency reference (10MHz distribution) - sufficient for spectrum monitoring
  - Level 2: Time synchronization (GPS + NTP/PTP) - for coordinated measurements
  - Level 3: Phase coherence - only for specialized applications requiring it
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced sync quality
- **Sync Quality Monitoring**: Continuous assessment and reporting of synchronization health
- **Fallback Methods**: Multiple sync sources with automatic fallback (GPS → NTP → local crystal)

```python
# Example sync quality handling
class SyncManager:
    def get_sync_quality(self) -> SyncQuality:
        if self.gps_locked and self.pps_stable:
            return SyncQuality.HIGH  # <1us accuracy
        elif self.ntp_synced:
            return SyncQuality.MEDIUM  # <10ms accuracy
        else:
            return SyncQuality.LOW  # Best effort
```
